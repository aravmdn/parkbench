# 07 — Multi-ride & the radar profile

**Status:** Living · **Last updated:** 2026-05-30

The post-v1 phase (decision **D-034**). v1 proved one ride can be scored reproducibly; this phase
delivers the project's headline output — the **diagnostic radar profile across skill axes** (D-007)
— which needs **≥2 rides on different axes**. See the roadmap ([`03-roadmap.md`](03-roadmap.md) #1).

## The ride abstraction (D-035)

A *ride* is a self-contained, scored capability test (D-002) that stays independent of the others
(D-008). The contract (`src/parkbench/axis.py`, `src/parkbench/rides.py`):

- **`Axis`** — one of the four skill families (D-005): `social` · `economic` · `coding` · `safety`.
- **`RideResult{ride, axis, agent, score, detail}`** — `score` is the ride's headline metric
  **normalized to `[0, 1]`** (1 = optimal), so dissimilar rides roll up onto one radar; `detail`
  holds the ride-specific breakdown.
- **`Ride`** protocol — `name`, `axis`, and `evaluate(agent_name, seed) -> RideResult`.
- **`RIDE_REGISTRY`** — the rides available for roll-up. New rides register here.

The negotiation ride (D-010) is wrapped as `NegotiationRide` (axis `social`); its normalized score is
mean efficiency. This wrapper is **additive** — the original `parkbench run` path is unchanged.

Each ride defines its own agent interface and ships its own baseline agents; the radar aggregates
whatever ride results exist for an agent.

## Still open

Anti-gaming / reward-hacking safeguards across rides remain an open question
([`04-open-questions.md`](04-open-questions.md)).
